.SH NAME
backupuser \- User backup utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "backupuser " "[-p [-s SCP_DESTINATION] -v local_disks ...] || [etc] || [restart]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
backupuser is a shell script utility, that allows a user to create backups of his home directory. These backups are placed in ${HOME}/backups. When invoking, all other non-option arguments passed to backupuser will be treated as external storage devices and the script will attempt to copy the backup to the given arguments.

If the file ${HOME}/bu_excludes.txt exists, then any files or folders mentioned in this file will not be backed up. To be excluded, files and folders should be indicated with their full path. If the special folder ${HOME}/.bu exists, any scripts that may reside in this folder will be parsed and processed prior to backup creation. In case the argument "restart" is passed upon invocation, then backupuser will clean the users backup directory ${HOME}/backups. The following special options exist for root: Upon passing "etc" as an argument, the utility will generate a backup of the system's /etc directory. 

When copying the backup to external storage, backupuser has an accompanying utility, \fBbu_check_files\fR, which can be used to verfify the integrity of the backups.
